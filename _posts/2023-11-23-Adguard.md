Go to Adguard Home project in github(github.com)
Navigate to latest release - currently - AdGuard Home v0.107.39(github.com)
Download your respective file, In case of most windows, it should be " AdGuardHome_windows_amd64.zip ".
Extract the " AdGuardHome " Folder in your C drive (you can extract at other locations as well but for simplicity I would extract the folder to C Drive)
Once extracted folder "AdGuardHome" to C drive, open windows terminal as Admin (for ease press " Windows + X " then select " Terminal (Admin) "
Type " cd C:\AdGuardHome "
Type " .\AdGuardHome.exe "
Allow the connections with firewall in windows
Press " Ctrl + C " or something else anything to stop the current command in the open terminal window.
Type " .\AdGuardHome.exe -s install ". (Congrats Adguard is now installed on your windows system. But it's not configured On just yet To fully configure continue further)
Open a webrowser and go to " localhost:3000 " or " localhost "
Setup a user name and password and follow prompts on that adguard home setup screen.
Verify you can acccess adguard by going to " localhost " or " localhost:3000 " and access their main dashboard (you wont see any filters, or websites their just yet ). Once setup you can access this dashboard on other devices (by going to IP address of this device assisnged by the modem/router it is connected to - something like 192.168.X.X "
At the Adguard Home dashboard, Go to " Setup Guide " near top right. Note down the DNS servers that Adguard Home is listening from. Especially one that is a format something like " 192.168.X.X ", or " 127.0.X.X " or " 172.22.X.X or something else ". Either one of these iP address is going to be needed later. I personally would like to bookmark this address or remember it like how you remember your phone number. In My opinion " 127.0.0.1 " is going to be best, as it doesn't change much ( but this can only be accessed from that windows device only ), if you like to access the adguard dashboard from another device in the LAN, then you need to use the LAN IP address of this machine that was assigned to this device by the higher up router/modem, (can also find it using cmd command " ipconfig ". It should be in the Setup Guide as well, and most likely be "192.168.X.X".
Setup on Windows:
Now we need to change the DNS of the windows OS, to do that open " Control Panel " > select " Network and Internet " > select " Network and Sharing Centre " > select " Change adapter settings " on the top left > Right click on your active connection (e.g. Wifi adapter, or Ethernet ) > select " Properties " > select " Internet Protocol Version 4 (TCP/lPv4) " > Select " Use: the following DNS server addresses: " type there DNS address you got from your adguard configration page (the one from Step 14) as the " Preferred DNS server: "
You dont need to put fill the " Alternative DNS server: " but you may use another one of the iP addresses you got from Step 14 here.
Select " Validate settings upon exit " and Click " Okay ", you might find troubleshooter running for slight while, just close it after sometime. Anyway Adguard home is now setup on your windows machine. You can verify it by going to some websites, and seeing them on Adguard Home Dashboard, (your adguard dashboard address might also have now changed to that iPv4 address you got from step 14. (" 192.168.X.X ", or " 127.0.X.X " or " 172.22.X.X "). Login there and edit the Adguard Home to your preferences.
Setup on Router:
Before going on with this step, please note it wont work with router's that dont allow DNS changing (like Belong modems), Nevertheless for most modems its gonna be fine and gonna be most important honestly, as you dont want to run the adguard/ablock on just 1 windows device rather on entire network I assume yeah (if No then dont follow these below steps) ?
Go to your router admin page, something like (192.168.0.1, 192.168.8.1, 192.168.1.1 or something like that its going to be specific to your router/modem brand, but you can generally find this address on the back of router/modem)
Naigate to settings in your router that allows changing the iPv4 DNS settings (this is again specific to your router/modem brand) if unsure try googling it for your modem/router model.
In here just like windows setup, enter Primary DNS server to the address you got from Step 14.
IMPORTANT- if your computer is not going to be running all the time, then make sure you put something else at Secondary DNS server, (something like Adguard Public DNS(adguard-dns.io) 94.140.14.14, or Cloudfare ( 1.1.1.1 ), or Google ( 8.8.8.8 ). This will ensure your router gets the DNS query resolved whenever it cannot talk your windows computer running Adguard Home (when it is away or shut down or something like that). It just wont be resolved by Adguard Home running on the windows machine.
In case your computer will be runing 24/7 all the time, then put another one of the DNS server addresses there as Secondary DNS server (from Step 14). Keeping in mind incase your modem is unable to resolve DNS by being unable to talk to Adguard DNS server, then you wont be able to access most websites.
Save the new DNS settings on router/modem, and Restart your modem/router to apply the new DNS settings to it.
Similar steps are also available on Setup Guide at Adguard Home Dashboard for setup in individual devices like Android, IOS, linux etc. (but it's kinda similar theme that you need to change DNS query resolver to one the DNS addresses that Adguard Home is listening onto.

Lastly:
Check your devices are actually talking to adguard home, and it is infact working. (if working then on Adguard Home Dashboard you should see DNS queries jump up each time you access a website or app or a DNS query is made by one of your devices connected to Adguard Home).
Additional Tips:
Now After you have Adguard Home up and running, I strongly suggest you configure it to your specifications, (add or remove DNS blocklists from Adguard Home Dashboard by going to " Filters > DNS blocklists > Add blocklist > Choose from the list> Select your desired ones "
Importantly now, As per we our OZbargainers, and more often than not access Cashback sites, and or other websites that rely upon ads, trackers etc to deliver their services to us. If you want to allow them to access trackers, ads etc, (from Adguard Home Dashboard) Go to " Filters> Custom filtering rules " add the exceptions here. Another way to add exceptions easily is by going to " Query Log " and on the blocked domains Click " Unblock " or " Unblock for this client only " depending on your choices. This is gonna be a long and tidious process, to know what things are crashing due to your newly introduced adblocking service (Btw Samsung Smarthings is one of them too)
To temporarily Stop adblock from blocking ads, trackers etc. you may go to Dashboard (I'm referring to Adgauard Home Dashboard by that, just cannot be bothered typing that entire thing again and again) and Click " Disable protection " if you like you may Disabled it for a specific time as well by choosing from one of the dropdown menu options.
Some notable custom filters for Shopback, Cashrewards are "
@@||tracking.shopback.com^$important
@@||cashrewards.com.au^$important
@@||cdp.cashrewards.com.au^$important
@@||t.cfjump.com^$important
" - copy and paste them to your custom filters list.
There could be more custom filtering exceptions needed, and you should test out what filters you need before hand (or disable the adblock for those times). Kindly dont blame me or those service providers for your purchases not tracking. I have already made you aware that this is one of the consequence of running such a service, and it is your responsibility to ensure you set your own rules according to your needs.
One Great feature about the Adguard Home is DNS rewrites, (it means redirecting a domain name, say "yourname.com" to a iP address (which could be any complicated iP address that you may not want to remember or just needed it shorterned on your LAN).
